# Data Science Portfolio
My name is Stephanie Halsing and Iâ€™m currently a data science graduate student at Merrimack College. This portfolio includes two projects that I completed for my R and Python Programming course in Fall 2023.


### R Project: Analysis of the Future Data Science Team
The project scenario is to create an analysis for your company that is looking to hire a full-time Data Scientist to help drive data science within the entire organization and lead a team in the near future.

Using R, I analyzed data scientist salaries using the interquartile range (IQR) to find a competitive range of salaries to attract top talent. My statistical analysis also includes the salary differences between onsite and offshore employment as well as company size. 

Please see the links below for my analysis and presentation.

### Python Project: Top 5 Cities for a Data Scientist
The project scenario is to find the top 5 cities where a Data Scientist's salary (in USD) will go the farthest with respect to each individual cost of living index.

I performed statistical analysis using Python to find the top 5 cities where an entry-level Data Scientist salary is the highest, then analyzed the cost of living index in each of those cities. The potential salary range is based on the interquartile range (IQR) and which determined the order on the cities based on the index. 

Please see the links below for my analysis and presentation.
